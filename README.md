The game logic is set up by assigning a letter, in alphabetical order, to each square from left to right, top to bottom.

    ====|====|====
      a |  b |  c

      d |  e |  f

Each player's move is added to their move pool and will be checked with the winning sets after the game is on the 4th turn.
